# Optional Kata

Dealing with Java 8 optionals in Kotlin

First with Optional methods only, no operators/methods from Kotlin nullables should be used
Go to the optional package:

1. Implement the function Company.getBossFullName using the findEmployee method
Make sure test all cases, no employee found, employee with a boss or employee without a boss

2. Implement the function Company.hireIfNotAlreadyEmployed using the hireEmployee method
Make sure to test that no current employee can't be hired. Ex: You can't hire an employee named Dilbert
The method should return the new employee if hired

Second round
Got to the nullable package, using operators/methods from Kotlin nullables only

1. Implement the function Company.getBossFullName using the findEmployee method

2. Implement the function Company.hireIfNotAlreadyEmployed using the hireEmployee method
